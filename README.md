# NLP Coursework Projects

This workspace gathers natural language processing projects completed during the NLP semester at the Asian Institute of Technology. Each top-level folder hosts a dedicated project or supporting resources.

## Repository Structure
- A1/ – Assignments focused on foundational word embedding techniques, including Word2Vec (skip-gram and negative sampling) and GloVe implementations.
- A2/ – Language modeling experiments with LSTMs, attention mechanisms, and an accompanying application scaffold.
- A3/ – Machine translation studies using sequence-to-sequence architectures with additive, multiplicative, and transformer-based attention.

## Getting Started
1. Create and activate the desired Python virtual environment (see the env folders for ready-made venvs).
2. Install package requirements listed in each assignment directory.
3. Open the project notebooks in Jupyter Lab or VS Code to reproduce experiments and explore results.

## Outputs and Models
Each and every project folder contains video and photo of projects with its results.
